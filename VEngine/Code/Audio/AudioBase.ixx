		//From the XAudio2 docs (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/xaudio2/ns-xaudio2-xaudio2_buffer#remarks),
		//they're saying that, "The data the structure points to (pAudioData and pDecodedPacketCumulativeBytes, respectively)
		//can't be freed until the buffer completes (as signaled by the IXAudio2VoiceCallback::OnBufferEnd callback)
		// or the voice is stopped or destroyed." This might mean that you'll have to look again into the audio code
		//and bring together both AudioBase and AudioChannel, that or have references to ensure that AudioBases are 
		//deleted only when everything is unloaded, which is fine for small scale projects, but will blow up
		//as soon as streaming is introduced.
